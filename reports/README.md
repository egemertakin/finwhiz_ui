# Reports

This directory houses milestone documentation, logs, and artifacts that support grading and internal reviews.

Current contents:

- `milestone2/` – Milestone 2 submission package (pipeline description, test outputs, UI mock-up links, outstanding TODOs).

Future milestones should follow the same pattern (`reports/milestone3/`, etc.) so reviewers can quickly find evidence of progress.
